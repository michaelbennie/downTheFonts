# downTheFonts
A tool to download (almost) all the fonts in Fedora Linux / RHEL.
With this, you will be able to render text in almost all languages.

## Install

Bash:
```bash
./downTheFonts.sh
```

Fish:
```fish
downTheFonts.fish
```

## Testing
You can test if all the fonts downloaded correctly by going to [wikipedia's font tester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Multilingual_support#Mongolian)
and seeing if most of the fonts will dispaly propely. Sadly, some fonts are still not fully supprted in Fedora's base repository.
